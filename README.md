## Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the necessary dependencies, proceed as follows: Open your command line, navigate to the designated folder (where server.js is located), and execute "node server.js". Upon successful execution, you'll receive the message "App listening on Port 3001!" in your terminal. We'll then move on to using Insomnia, as illustrated in the accompanying video.
